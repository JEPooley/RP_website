                        <h3>How, Where, Why</h3>
                        <p>
                            Tutorials will still be one-to-one, and face-to-face, but mediated by the internet. Students will need access to a computer (PC, tablet) but all software will be free and publicly available. Students will also need a webcam, microphone, and headphones.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My aim is to provide a home learning package which is workable, of good quality, and priced reasonably, to reflect the circumstances in which we find ourselves. It is clearly important for people to continue with their education whenever they can, and I would hope to be able to help with this.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is a new service which I am offering here, and it will be necessary for me to work cooperatively and constructively with students and parents in order to find ways to best suit their needs. In particular, I would welcome feedback at any time.
                        </p>

                    <div class="fee_box">
                        <h3>A Typical Lesson Online</h3>
                        <p>
                            A typical maths lesson online will be scheduled to last 45 minutes within a designated one hour period. Thus, for instance, we would agree to hold a session between, say, 3-4pm every Tuesday.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Face to face interchange is by a proprietary internet whiteboard package. Full instructions will be given, but it is normally very easy to use. On or shortly after the start of the designated time period, I will send a link to the student by email which they then have to enter into their browser. A couple of simple steps later, and they will be logged on to a shared whiteboard with a small inset video/audio link so that we can see and talk to each other.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We will both be able to write, type and draw on the board, as well as both being able to upload related information in the form of .png and pdf files. The lesson will then proceed in a very similar manner to ordinary face-to-face lessons, with a mixture of formal explanations from me, problem solving tasks for the student, and general discussion of the issues.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Homework</h3>
                        <p>
                            Homework is optional, and is offered as a complementary service on top of the standard 45 minute session. A small amount of homework, earnestly attempted, is a good way to maximise the benefits of the tutorial sessions. If homework is requested, then it would be sent by email attachment within one working day. Answers to homework questions can either be discussed at the next session, or else tutees are welcome to send a facsimilie of their answers by email attachment for me to mark.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="fee_box">
                        <h3>Sending me attachments e.g. Homework</h3>
                        <p>
                            There are maths typesetting packages available which I use for printing homework sheets, but these require some amount of investigating. Probably the easiest method for tutees would be to write up answers by hand, scan these into the computer, and then email them to me as an attachment.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="fee_box">
                        <h3>Equipment you will require</h3>
                        <p>
                            You will need either a PC, tablet, or a mobile, although a mobile is far from ideal. Ideally the whiteboard needs to be operated on a device which can be used with a stylus, although fingers can achieve something. If the whiteboard is on a PC then a “drawing tablet” will be definitely be needed (e.g. WACOM). This is what I use, and it is great for the wide screen whiteboard which my PC affords. Apart from that, internet access and a browser.
