                        <h3>How, Where, Why</h3>
                        <p>
                            All teaching is on a one-to-one basis - this is the very best way to tailor a student's 
                            learning to their individual needs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Lessons are conducted at my house, in a quiet and comfortable environment, 
                            away from the habitual distractions of home and school.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All lessons are of one hour duration, probably the optimal period for any kind of study session. 
                            Less than one hour is often not long enough to discuss and develop difficult concepts. 
                            On the other hand, a break is advisable if continuing beyond one hour.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Minimal use is made of internet and computer technology. 
                            Lessons are usually a combination of work at the desk with pencil and paper, 
                            combined with more expansive explanations from the whiteboard. 
                            There are very reasonably priced coursebooks and revision books available in most maths syllabuses, 
                            and these are used wherever possible as a basis for tutorial sessions.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="fee_box">
                        <h3>Homework</h3>
                        <p>
                            Homework is optional and problem sheets are sent by e-mail on a next-day basis if requested. 
                            Students are never required to complete homework. Homework is considered to be a mixed blessing, 
                            and can add to the already considerable burdens of a student's school life. 
                            On the other hand, a little light homework can create a sense of continuity for a student between lessons, 
                            which are very often a week apart. 
                            Homework also gives me an excellent indication of how well a topic has actually been grasped. 
                            If students have made an attempt at the homework, 
                            they usually bring their script to the next lesson for discussion and review.

                        <h3>Syllabus</h3>
                        <p>
                            Maths coaching is offered across KS3, GCSE, IGCSE, A-Level, and Further Maths in all syllabuses, 
                            and for all examination boards, usually AQA, Edexcel, or OCR. 
                            University entrance and first year University work are a possibility, 
                            but this would depend on the specific requirements of the student, at these more specialised levels.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="fee_box">
                        <h3>Bookings</h3>
                        <p>
                            During weekdays in term, my regular hourly slots are 4-5pm, 5-6pm, and 6-7pm each day, 
                            but lessons can be arranged any time outside these hours to suit. 
                            I am also available Saturday mornings, with four possible hourly slots, 
                            starting at 8am and running through to 12.00 noon. Outside of school terms, regular hours do not apply, 
                            and lessons can be arranged any time as required.
                        </p>

                    <div class="fee_box">
                        <h3>Modes of Study</h3>
                        <p>
                            Preparation for exams is the express motive for most students taking maths coaching. 
                            Of course, this will involve working on past papers together during lessons, 
                            but, depending on the time available, 
                            I find it is often useful to lay the foundation with a short course in the basics. 
                            For instance, at GCSE, a couple of hours' formal study of, say, 
                            fractions, can yield great benenfit, even when exams are imminent.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Whilst last minute tutoring before an exam can be beneficial, 
                            many students choose to take reqular hourly sessions each week in good time for their exams, 
                            and often for the duration of their course work, which is 2-years for GCSE and A-level. 
                            I can offer complete courses if desired, 
                            or I am very happy to work on particular problems each week, for instance, 
                            on something a student has not understood at school or college. 
                            Learning maths is a challenge for everyone, and my philosophy is to be very flexible in my approach, and to work 
                            with the agreement of the student at every step.
                        </p>

                    <div class="fee_box">
                        <h3>Exam Stress</h3>
                        <p>
                           Exam stress is a serious problem for a lot of students, and may be a growing problem in general.
                           Exam stress can be ameliorated, at least to some extent, by improving a student's proficiency
                           in the subject, along with a well rehearsed exam technique. Nevertheless, in order to maximise a student's talents, 
                           it is also vital to foster a healthy sense of the context of exams within their overall development.
                           
                        </p>

                        <h3>Introductory Session</h3>
                        <p>
                            If you are interested in taking maths tuition with me then I am pleased to offer 
                            an initial, no-strings, one-hour taster session at half the regular price quoted. 
                            This normally starts with a 20 minute discussion of the student's particular requirements, 
                            and would usually include the student's parent or guardian. 
                            There is then a short taster one-to-one session with the student to complete the hour. 
                            Alternatively, I am happy to offer a free, no-strings, 1/2 hour consultation session.
                        </p>
